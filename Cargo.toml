# If you plan on using a riscv32 MCU like ESP32C3:
#   Always include this patch in your workspace / final binary crate as it is patching libc
#   to support the riscv32 architecture with newlib. A similar patch for the xtensa architecture
#   (ESP32, ESP32S2, ESP32S3) is already in libc since libc 0.2.76
# NOTE: Since 2021-08-12, you DON'T need these below, when using stock Rust 1.56!
